# Editor Configuration

After you create an Unreal Engine project for C++, you need to tell Unreal which editor (IDE) to use. 

Go to ```Edit (Menu) -> Editor Preferences... -> General -> Source Code -> Source Code Editor: Visual Studio Code```

![Source Code Editor](vscode_editor_pref.png){: w="600" h="300" }


# Build Configuration

Select the ```Debug: Select and Start Debugging``` command by pressing ```Ctrl + Alt + F5```, this will display the options 
you have to build your project:

![Debug: Select and Start Debugging](vscode_run_conf_1.png){: w="600" h="300" }

Normally, if you are debugging, select the option ```Launch ProjectName + Editor + (Development)```
