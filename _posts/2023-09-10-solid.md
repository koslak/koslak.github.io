SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable[^footnote].

### The **S**ingle-responsibility principle (SRP)
**"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."** In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

### The **O**penâ€“closed principle (OCP)
**"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**
        The OCP tell us that we should be able to extend our software (open for extension). However, the extension should be easy and, in the best case, possibly by just adding new code. In other words, we shouldn't have to modify existing code (closed for modification)[^fn-nth-2].

> OCP advises that we should not have to modify existing code but **on the same architectural level or on higher levels**. However, there is no way you can control or prevent modifications on the lower levels of your architecture[^fn-nth-2].

### The **L**iskov substitution principle (LSP)
**"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."**

### The **I**nterface segregation principle (ISP)
**"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."** The ISP advises separating concerns by segregating (decoupling) interfaces.

## The **D**ependency inversion principle (DIP)
**"Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."**
